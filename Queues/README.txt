This program Queues, is meant to explore the ideas of a circular queue, orignally starting out as a project for CS, but explored re-coded so that I could get a better understanding of ciruclar queues. This program creates a circular queue, with each index of the queue pointing to a stack. This supports the basic functions of a queue, such as enqueue() and deqeueue(), along with the ability to append to a stack of a specified index in the queue.
